                    <h3>Preparing your Tier 4 Visa application</h3>
                    <p>If you want to come to the UK to study, you need to apply to the UK immigration authorities under Tier 4 of the Points Based System (PBS). You must meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules which are in force on the date that you submit your immigration application.</p>					
                    <p>If you want to make a successful Tier 4 (General) application, it is extremely important that you:</p>
                    <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">

                        <li>Allow plenty of time to obtain the documents required to make your application</li>
                        <li>Provide your supporting documents in the exact format required by the Home Office, as explained in the policy guidance and on the application form</li>
                        <li>Complete all sections of the form, fully and accurately</li>
                        <li>Check your application will not risk being refused under the general grounds for refusal</li>

                    <!-- <h5>Scholarship assistance</h5>
                    <p>Scholarships are available based on every studentâ€™s academic excellence. There are hundreds of scholarships available. We help to find the right scholarship for all students</p>										
                    <h5>Student loan/accommodation loan</h5>
                    <p>Finance is very important of the higher studies. All the students must show tuition fee + accommodation fees before applying for a visa. We work with a nationalised bank and help all the students to apply for an education loan.</p>										
                    <h5>Visa guidance</h5>
                    <p>This is an important and second stage of the student admission. Without a student visa nobody can enter any country to study. Visa conditions should be met by all students. If not, visa will be refused. We advise all students on all the visa requirements before applying. We are happy to share that we have 100% success in our visa guidance.</p>										 -->
